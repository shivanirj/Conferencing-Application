Ant Media Server has a built-in conference feature. But some users want to extend that feature. So we have created this project as a different project. The main idea under this project is managing the conference participants with this application and using Ant Media Server as a media server to publish/play streams with WebRTC. 
You can build it with redeploy.sh. This script will create a war file. Then copy it into AMS_INSTALL_DIR/webapps.
After Ant Media Server deploys it automatically, you can use it from
